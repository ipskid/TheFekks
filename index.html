		<h2 id="bio">BIOGRAPHY:</h2>
	
		<p>The Fekks came together in 2009 among schoolmates united by common
			musical tastes. In 2012 they debuted with the release of &lsquo;Retrospectator&rsquo;, a
			small sample of the band’s first works - a sound that reflects the influences
			of alternative rock, indie, and synth folk that initially united the band. With
			the departure to university, however, the members distanced themselves, but
			continued to record and write music with every opportunity they had.</p>

		<p>In 2018, with the band constituted by Aran, Francisco and Christopher, The
			Fekks released their first EP, &lsquo;Sad Circus&rsquo;, an album recorded in the band's
			DIY studio, affectionately dubbed Trap Door Studios. In 2019 Bernardo
			joined on bass, <em>and Marcelino</em> on drums. The band then participated in the
			artistic residence in Escola do Rock, and thus The Fekks returned to the stage
			with a mini-tour throughout the most beloved locations and venues of
			Paredes de Coura.</p>

		<p>The band is now in rehearsals, preparing new projects and ready for their 
			public debut in full format.</p>
